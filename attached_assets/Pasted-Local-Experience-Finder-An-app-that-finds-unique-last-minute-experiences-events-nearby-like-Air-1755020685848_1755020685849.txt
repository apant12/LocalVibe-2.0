Local Experience Finder – An app that finds unique, last-minute experiences/events nearby (like “Airbnb Experiences meets TikTok”).


ChatGPT said:
That idea could actually hit in 2025 — especially if you make it fast, fun, and “scrollable” instead of the typical clunky event app.

Here’s how I’d break it down so it’s attention-grabbing:

Core Concept
A mobile app that helps people find unique things to do nearby right now — blending:

Airbnb Experiences → curated, cool activities

TikTok → fast, short, visual content

Yelp → location & filtering

FOMO → scarcity and time-limited events

Target Users
Travelers – People visiting a city who don’t want to plan weeks ahead.

Locals – People bored at home on a Friday night, looking for something to do today.

Date Planners – Someone who needs a fun date idea in the next few hours.

Friend Groups – Last-minute hangouts.

Killer Features
TikTok-style feed – Short vertical videos of local experiences (cocktail class, rooftop party, hidden museum exhibit, pop-up market).

Instant filter – “Happening within 3 hours” / “Free” / “Outdoor” / “Food & Drink.”

One-tap booking – No long forms, Apple Pay/Google Pay for instant reservation.

“Drop-in now” mode – Shows things you can literally walk into without a ticket.

Social proof – See friends who’ve gone or are “interested.”

Gamified streaks – Earn points/badges for trying new places, which unlock discounts.

Why This Would Get Attention
No one wants to scroll through boring, text-heavy event lists. This is visual, fast, and impulsive.

Great for social media virality — every event video doubles as marketing for the app.

High FOMO factor (“only 3 spots left for tonight’s hidden speakeasy tour!”).

Monetization
10–20% commission from bookings.

Featured spots for businesses.

Subscription for “VIP” early access to high-demand events.

MVP Build Path
Start in one city (Austin, Miami, NYC — somewhere with constant events).

Scrape + partner with local event lists / small businesses.

Record 15–20 short TikTok-style videos for launch content.

Let early users upload their own event clips for free tickets/rewards.

If you want, I can map out a full “first 90 days” launch plan so you know exactly how to get an MVP out, grab users, and make it look alive even with few events at the start.
That’s the make-or-break part for something like this.
